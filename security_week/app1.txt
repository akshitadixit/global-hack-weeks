Input Validation:
The sanitize_input() function is implemented to sanitize user input by removing leading and trailing whitespaces.
You can enhance this function with additional input validation logic as per your requirements.

Parameterized Queries:
The execute_query() function is used to execute database queries with parameters.
It ensures that the parameters are properly sanitized and prevents SQL injection attacks.
In this example, the execute_query() function is a placeholder, and you need to implement the actual
logic using a database library like SQLAlchemy.

Secure Session Management:
The generate_unique_session_id() function is responsible for generating a unique session identifier.
In this example, we use the uuid module to generate a random UUID. You can choose your own method for generating session identifiers.
Flask's session management is utilized by setting the app.secret_key attribute with a secret key.
This key is used to sign the session cookies and protect them from tampering.
Flask automatically handles the session encryption and storage in cookies.
In the login() route, upon successful authentication, the user's username is stored in the session using session['username'] = username.
 This establishes a secure session for the user.

 Password Security:
The code assumes that passwords are stored in a hashed form in the database. The example uses the bcrypt library to
hash and verify passwords. During login, the code retrieves the hashed password from the database and compares it
with the provided password using bcrypt.checkpw(). This ensures that passwords are securely stored and compared
without exposing the actual passwords.

Principle of Least Privilege:
The /admin route demonstrates an example of implementing the principle of least privilege.
Only users with the username 'admin' are granted access to the admin panel.
This can be customized to suit your specific requirements, such as checking for specific roles or permissions associated with the user.

Regular Updates:
While the code example doesn't explicitly demonstrate regular updates,
it's crucial to keep all software, libraries, and frameworks up to date to ensure you
have the latest security patches. Regularly updating Flask, its dependencies,
and any other used libraries will help mitigate known security vulnerabilities.
