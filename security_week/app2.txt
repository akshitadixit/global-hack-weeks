Headers are like special messages that computers send to each other when they communicate over the internet.
They contain important information about the data being sent or how it should be handled.
 Think of headers as instructions that tell the computers how to behave when they exchange information.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):
The Strict-Transport-Security header is set with a value of 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'.
This header tells the browser to only access the website over HTTPS for a maximum age of 31,536,000 seconds (1 year).
It also includes subdomains and indicates that the website should be included in the HSTS preload list maintained by browsers.

magine you want to send a secret message to your friend, and you want to make sure nobody else can read it.
HSTS is like a special seal that you put on your message to make sure it travels securely.
It tells the browser that it should always use a secure connection (like HTTPS) when talking to a specific website.
This makes it harder for bad people to intercept and read the messages.

X-XSS-Protection:
The X-XSS-Protection header is set with a value of '1; mode=block'.
This header enables the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanism.
The 1 value indicates that XSS protection should be enabled, and the mode=block directive instructs the browser to
block the response if an XSS attack is detected.

XSS stands for Cross-Site Scripting, which is a fancy term for when bad people try to put harmful things (like viruses)
into websites that you visit. X-XSS-Protection is like a security shield that protects you from these harmful things.
It tells the browser to be on guard and block any harmful code that it might find in the website you're visiting.

X-Content-Type-Options:
The X-Content-Type-Options header is set with a value of 'nosniff'.
This header prevents the browser from MIME-sniffing the response content type.
Setting it to 'nosniff' ensures that the browser follows the declared content type and doesn't try to infer it based on the content.

Sometimes, bad people try to trick computers into thinking that a file is something different from what it actually is.
It's like someone giving you a box of chocolates, but inside it, there's actually a scary spider!
X-Content-Type-Options is like a magic spell that tells the browser to always trust the declared type of
the file and not try to guess what it is. This helps prevent some sneaky attacks.

X-Frame-Options:
The X-Frame-Options header is set with a value of 'SAMEORIGIN'.
This header prevents the page from being loaded in a frame or iframe from a different origin.
By setting it to 'SAMEORIGIN', the page can only be framed by pages from the same origin.

Have you ever seen a picture frame? It's a nice way to display a picture and keep it safe.
X-Frame-Options is like a rule that tells the browser not to display a website inside a frame or an iframe
from a different website. It's like saying, "Only show this website in its own frame,
so nobody can trick you by showing it in a different frame." This helps protect you from some tricks that bad people might try to play.

The set_security_headers() function is registered as an after_request handler, which means it will be
executed after each request and modify the response headers accordingly.
